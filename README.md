## ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
I'm Bog, originally from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ but spent most of my life in Spain. I'm a Full Stack developer who also acted as a DevOps Engineer and Scrum Master. Currently working on my own projects - my interests include cross platform development and web development. In the future I'd like to dive further into ML and cyber security, maybe more a bit of Open Source as well.  

Additionally I also do stuff like [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/bgdnvk) and I'm involved in [Hope](http://proyectohope.centromedicodespierta.es/).

Slowly working on my [BLOG](https://bognov.tech/)

Some personal info: used to spend a lot of time in Denmark prior to Covid, almost moved there and to another scandi country but the weather is too good in Spain. I'm open to travel or work from anywhere.
