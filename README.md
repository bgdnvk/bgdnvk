## ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
I'm Bog, originally from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ but spent most of my life in Spain. I'm a Full Stack developer who also acted as a DevOps Engineer and Scrum Master. Currently working on my own projects - my interests include cross platform development and web development. In the future I'd like to dive further into ML and cyber security.

Additionally I also do stuff like [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/bgdnvk) and I'm involved in [Hope](http://proyectohope.centromedicodespierta.es/).

Slowly working on my [BLOG](https://bognov.tech/) as well.

Since the invasion of Russia in Ukraine I've been building an organization "AyudaUcrania" to spread awareness on how to help affected citizens and refugees. [If you know Spanish have a look.](https://ayudaucrania.org/) So far we are 4 people now.

More personal info: used to spend a lot of time in Denmark prior to Covid, almost moved there and to another scandi country but the weather is too good in Spain. I'm open to travel or work from anywhere. 

Before getting fully into the tech path I was doing a degree in philosophy, hopefully in the future I will have enough time to finish it.
I'm very curious, this means I enjoy talking with different people about different topics, as this broadens my horizons, so feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tekbog) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdan-novykov/).
