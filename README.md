## Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm Bog, originally from Ukraine but spent most of my life in Spain. Right now I'm focusing on JS/React but later I want to dive more into .NET, Flutter and of course do more Machine Learning.
Additionally I also enjoy programming challenges like the ones at [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/bgdnvk)
