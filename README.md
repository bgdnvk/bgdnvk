# About me ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
I'm Bog, originally from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ but I'm a Spaniard now.  
Overall I define myself as a Full Stack Developer or Software Engineer and I have experience as a CTO as well. My interests include cross platform development, web development and the DevOps space. In the future I'd like to focus more on: TypeScript, Go and Rust. As well as learn more about ML.

Additionally I also do stuff like [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/bgdnvk) and I'm involved in [Hope](http://proyectohope.centromedicodespierta.es/).

I'm currently working on my [ðŸ“š BLOG ðŸ“š](https://bognov.tech/) as well. Which has been featured several times on Hashnode as well as daily.dev and Kubesimplify.

Since the invasion of Russia in Ukraine I've been building an organization "AyudaUcrania" to spread awareness on how to help affected citizens and refugees. [If you know Spanish have a look.](https://ayudaucrania.org/) So far we are 4 people now.

More personal info: used to spend a lot of time in Denmark prior to Covid, almost moved there and to another scandi country but the weather is too good in Spain. I'm open to travel or work from anywhere. 

Before getting fully into the tech path I was doing a degree in philosophy, hopefully in the future I will have enough time to finish it.
I'm very curious, this means I enjoy talking with different people about different topics, as this broadens my horizons, so feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tekbog) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdan-novykov/).
