   
```
     Real Programmers write in FORTRAN.
 
 Maybe they do now,
 in this decadent era of
 Lite beer, hand calculators, and ‚Äúuser-friendly‚Äù software
 but back in the Good Old Days,
 when the term ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù sounded funny
 and Real Computers were made out of drums and vacuum tubes,
 Real Programmers wrote in machine code.
 Not FORTRAN.  Not RATFOR.  Not, even, assembly language.
 Machine Code.
 Raw, unadorned, inscrutable hexadecimal numbers.
 Directly.
